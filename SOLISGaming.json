1. Keep names of Tribes, Players, Steam profiles and dinos clean & two players are not allowed to have the same name...First come, first serve.

1.Cheating and/or glitching is forbidden (e.g. floating base, building under the map etc.)!
2.Feel free to offer & help new players but remember a lot of the early game is the excitement of building up and learning to play ARK.Please donâ€™t give away high level gear to new players as this could ruin the enjoyment of the game.Dont under ANY circumstances give any player end tier dinos.You can help a player with a Pteranodon or Parasaur. Dont give them an Argi,certainly dont give them a Rex. Especially ones that are already at 250+ stats.You are NOT helping them, you are ruining their chances to experience the reality of the game. Doing this could result in a tribe wipe and or even a BAN from our servers. Trading in equavilent levels (Stats) dinos are allowed.
3.Keeping dinos on wandering or mating all the time is forbidden (Exception: game mechanics like those from dung beetle, oviraptor etc.) If you lost a dino do the following: 
		Open your chat window and type in /finddino

			This will shows all dinos that are

				- not in range of any structures of the same team
				- no teammember was in range for x hours

		Or type in /finddino value, 
		
		shows all dinos where  - dinoname, dinotype or level includes the value

4.Using multiple accounts is allowed as long as no other rules are bypassed/ exploited.
6.Tribe names have to be identical on all servers in the cluster -  Using different tribenames in the cluster is on your own risk!
7.Players are only allowed to create one character per Steam account! Ignoring this rule can lead to the loss of all structures and dinosaurs!
8.There is an Auto-Decay system on the server (Every map has its own timers. Just being on one map does not reset timers on other maps.)
                   Thatch - 8 Days
                   Wood - 16 Days
                   Stone - 24 Days
                   Metal - 32 Days",
	"Tab2Text2":"1.Harassing other players is forbidden. This includes Nazi content, insults, sexist and radical expressions as well as verbal abuse.

2. PvP behavior on PvE is forbidden (e.g. thievery and homicide).
3.Any loot beacon is claimed by the first player arriving at the exact drop location.
- In terms of air drops a video must be provided to proof the claim to resolve the dispute... (use ShadowPlay or similar tools)
- Extinction: Orbital Drops have to be claimed in the Global Chat with exact Co-ords (i.e. Orbital Drop at 71.3 40.9 claimed!). To proof the claim make a screenshot with map, orbital drop and visible server time (hold H ingame) in one picture.
4.Luring dinos to bases is forbidden (unless it is your own base).
5.Parking dinos outside of bases is forbidden. We will remove these dinos without warning.
6. Behavior that harms the atmosphere on the server is forbidden. In case of a dispute we will decide whats bad behavior and whats not.
For example, instead of saying player XY is cheating just collect as much evidence as you can and submit a ticket to inform us. Well take care of everything else.",
