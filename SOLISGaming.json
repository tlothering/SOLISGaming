		Please take a moment to review the rules below. If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to an admin via the WebUI ticket system or our Discord.
		
		Happy taming, building, and exploring!",

		"Tab1Text3":"",
		"Tab2Text1":"- Be respectful: No harassment, hate speech, or toxic behavior.
		- No griefing: This includes foundation spamming, blocking resources, or trolling players.
		- No exploiting glitches, bugs, or unintended mechanics.",
		"Tab2Text2":"- Build away from key locations (e.g., obelisks, caves with artifacts, rare resource spawns)
		- One main base per tribe, plus one outpost (e.g., farming or taming base).
		- No excessive land claiming—structures that go unused may be removed by admins.
		- Keep bases optimized—limit unnecessary spam structures to reduce lag.",
		"Tab2Text3":"- Do not block or cage high-level wild creatures for long periods.
		- Keep breeding reasonable—excessive dino hoarding can cause lag.
		- Any unwanted dinos should be unclaimed in a designated Dino Adoption Area or responsibly",
		"Tab3Text1":"- Do not block or monopolize high-value resources (metal, crystal, oil, etc.).
		- No killing passive creatures that belong to other players.
		- Be mindful of community areas (such as teleporters, marketplaces, or public utilities).",
		"Tab3Text2":"- Trade fairly—Avoid sharing high-value items with new players.
		- Help new players by offering guidance, not just free items.
		- Report any exploits to admins.",
		"Tab3Text3":"- Respect admin decisions—do not spam complaints or harass staff.
		- Use the WebUI ticket system or Discord for issues and bug reports. (Coming soon)
		- Cheating, exploiting, or abusing mechanics will result in immediate action.",
		"Tab4Text1":"- No AFK farming, excessive auto-clicking, or macro abuse.
		- Automated farms (e.g., gachas, dinos on wander) must be supervised and optimized to avoid lag.",
