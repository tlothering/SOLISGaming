Welcome to the ZARK Gaming Club, a family-friendly, dino-taming, base-building, poop-collecting paradise in the heart of South Africa!
    
We're absolutely raptor-ous to have you here. Our mission? Deliver the ultimate PvE experience without the griefers, chaos, or surprise T-Rex in your living room (unless you wanted one there).
To keep the island drama-free and the dinos happy, we've got a few house rules... nothing too wild, just enough to keep things civil while you ride your dino into the sunset.
Take a minute (yes, even you with the itchy 'punch everything' finger) to read rules 1 to 3 above. Still confused? Need a hug? Or just want to tattle on someone who named their dodo 'Thanos'? An Admin is just a Discord ticket away (coming soon).
    
Server stats you actually want to read (Yes, really):
Welcome to a server so boosted, even your pickaxe's pickaxe is getting a raise! Here’s what you're working with:
    
- 10x Harvesting Rates : One swing and BOOM: you've got enough wood to build a small village (or an unnecessarily large toilet).
- 220 Max Wild Dino Limit : More dinos than you can poke with a tranq arrow. Tame wisely. Or don't. We like chaos.
- 16 Mods, Featuring all the fan favorites:
- S+ : Because vanilla building is for cavemen.
- Steampunk : Where mad science meets Victorian drip. You're weird. We love it.
- Castles, Keeps & Forts : Build like a medieval neanderthall, the distant cousin who thinks S+ is sorcery and still punches trees for fun.
- RR-Home Deko : Fancy up your thatch shack.
- QoL Mods : For all the quality-of-lifers out there.

And more goodies we're too lazy to list but you'll definitely thank us for later.
    
So get out there – tame it, build it, explore it... or get eaten trying."
